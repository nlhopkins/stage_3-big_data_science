author = "d'Adda di Fagagna, Fabrizio and Weller, Geoffrey R and Doherty, Aidan J and Jackson, Stephen P",
abstract = "Mu bacteriophage inserts its DNA into the genome of host bacteria and is used as a model for DNA transposition events in other systems. The eukaryotic Ku protein has key roles in DNA repair and in certain transposition events. Here we show that the Gam protein of phage Mu is conserved in bacteria, has sequence homology with both subunits of Ku, and has the potential to adopt a similar architecture to the core DNA-binding region of Ku. Through biochemical studies, we demonstrate that Gam and the related protein of Haemophilus influenzae display DNA binding characteristics remarkably similar to those of human Ku. In addition, we show that Gam can interfere with Ty1 retrotransposition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These data reveal structural and functional parallels between bacteriophage Gam and eukaryotic Ku and suggest that their functions have been evolutionarily conserved.",

author = "Fuller, James R and Rice, Phoebe A",
abstract = "The transposition of bacteriophage Mu serves as a model system for understanding DDE transposases and integrases. All available structures of these enzymes at the end of the transposition reaction, including Mu, exhibit significant bends in the transposition target site DNA. Here we use Mu to investigate the ramifications of target DNA bending on the transposition reaction. Enhancing the flexibility of the target DNA or prebending it increases its affinity for transpososomes by over an order of magnitude and increases the overall reaction rate. This and FRET confirm that flexibility is interrogated early during the interaction between the transposase and a potential target site, which may be how other DNA binding proteins can steer selection of advantageous target sites. We also find that the conformation of the target DNA after strand transfer is involved in preventing accidental catalysis of the reverse reaction, as conditions that destabilize this conformation also trigger reversal.",

author = "Shapiro, J A",
abstract = "A series of molecular events will explain how genetic elements can transpose from one DNA site to another, generate a short oligonucleotide duplication at both ends of the new insertion site, and replicate in the transposition process. These events include the formation of recombinant molecules which have been postulated to be intermediates in the transposition process. The model explains how the replication of bacteriophage Mu is obligatorily associated with movement to new genetic sites. It postulates that all transposable elements replicate in the transposition process so that they remain at their original site while moving to new sites. According to this model, the mechanism of transposition is very different from the insertion and excision of bacteriophage lambda.",

title = "The Mu story: how a maverick phage moved the field forward",
author = "Harshey, Rasika M",
abstract = "This article traces the pioneering contributions of phage Mu to our current knowledge of how movable elements move/transpose. Mu provided the first molecular evidence of insertion elements in E. coli, postulated by McClintock to control gene activity in maize in the pre-DNA era. An early Mu-based model successfully explained all the DNA rearrangements associated with transposition, providing a blueprint for navigating the deluge of accumulating reports on transposable element activity. Amplification of the Mu genome via transposition meant that its transposition frequencies were orders of magnitude greater than any rival, so it was only natural that the first in vitro system for transposition was established for Mu. These experiments unraveled the chemistry of the phosphoryl transfer reaction of transposition, and shed light on the nucleoprotein complexes within which they occur. They hastened a similar analysis of other transposons and ushered in the structural era where many transpososomes were crystallized. While it was a lucky break that the mechanism of HIV DNA integration turned out to be similar to that of Mu, it is no accident that current drugs for HIV integrase inhibitors owe their discovery to trailblazing experiments done with Mu. Shining the light on how movable elements restructure genomes, Mu has also given of itself generously to understanding the genome.",

author = "Stoddard, S F and Howe, M M",
abstract = "Mu promoters active during the lytic cycle were located by isolating RNA at various times after induction of Mu prophages, radiolabeling it by capping in vitro, and hybridizing it to Mu DNA fragments on Southern blots. Signals were detected from four new promoters in addition to the previously characterized Pe (early), PcM (repressor), and Pmom (late) promoters. A major signal upstream of C was first observed at 12 min and intensified thereafter with RNA from cts and C amber but not replication-defective prophages; these characteristics indicate that this signal arises from a middle promoter, which we designate Pm. With 20- and 40-min RNA, four additional major signals originated in the C-lys, F-G-I, N-P, and com-mom regions. These signals were missing with RNA from C amber and replication-defective prophages and therefore reflected the activity of late promoters, one of which we presume was Pmom. Uninduced lysogens showed weak signals from five regions, one from the early regulatory region, three between genes B and lys, and one near the late genes K, L, and M. The first of these probably resulted from PcM activity; the others remain to be identified.",

abstract = "The transposition-replication reaction of phage Mu has been reproduced in a cell-free reaction system. Two assay methods were used for the detection of transposition products. The first method uses lambda DNA as the target of transposition and a plasmid containing the ends of Mu DNA and an ampicillin-resistance gene as the donor; after the reaction, in vitro lambda packaging allows the scoring of ampr transducing phages generated by transposition. In the second method, the products made in the presence of a radioactive precursor for DNA synthesis are directly analyzed by gel electrophoresis and unique product species are identified. The reaction requires a donor DNA carrying the two Mu ends in their proper relative orientation, extracts containing the A and B gene products of Mu, and host factor(s). RNA synthesis by E. coli RNA polymerase is not required for the reaction. The products include both cointegrates and simple inserts. Both types of products show incorporation of radioactive DNA precursors; however, simple inserts do not seem to undergo a full round of DNA replication.",

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities.

author = "Bhattacharyya, Sudipta and Soniat, Michael M and Walker, David and Jang, Sooin and Finkelstein, Ilya J and Harshey, Rasika M",
abstract = "The Gam protein of transposable phage Mu is an ortholog of eukaryotic and bacterial Ku proteins, which carry out nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) with the help of dedicated ATP-dependent ligases. Many bacteria carry Gam homologs associated with either complete or defective Mu-like prophages, but the role of Gam in the life cycle of Mu or in bacteria is unknown. Here, we show that MuGam is part of a two-component bacterial NHEJ DNA repair system. Ensemble and single-molecule experiments reveal that MuGam binds to DNA ends, slows the progress of RecBCD exonuclease, promotes binding of NAD+-dependent Escherichia coli ligase A, and stimulates ligation. In vivo, Gam equally promotes both precise and imprecise joining of restriction enzyme-digested linear plasmid DNA, as well as of a double-strand break (DSB) at an engineered I-SceI site in the chromosome. Cell survival after the induced DSB is specific to the stationary phase. In long-term growth competition experiments, particularly upon treatment with a clastogen, the presence of gam in a Mu lysogen confers a distinct fitness advantage. We also show that the role of Gam in the life of phage Mu is related not to transposition but to protection of genomic Mu copies from RecBCD when viral DNA packaging begins. Taken together, our data show that MuGam provides bacteria with an NHEJ system and suggest that the resulting fitness advantage is a reason that bacteria continue to retain the gam gene in the absence of an intact prophage.",
