author = "d'Adda di Fagagna, Fabrizio and Weller, Geoffrey R and Doherty, Aidan J and Jackson, Stephen P",
abstract = "Mu bacteriophage inserts its DNA into the genome of host bacteria and is used as a model for DNA transposition events in other systems. The eukaryotic Ku protein has key roles in DNA repair and in certain transposition events. Here we show that the Gam protein of phage Mu is conserved in bacteria, has sequence homology with both subunits of Ku, and has the potential to adopt a similar architecture to the core DNA-binding region of Ku. Through biochemical studies, we demonstrate that Gam and the related protein of Haemophilus influenzae display DNA binding characteristics remarkably similar to those of human Ku. In addition, we show that Gam can interfere with Ty1 retrotransposition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These data reveal structural and functional parallels between bacteriophage Gam and eukaryotic Ku and suggest that their functions have been evolutionarily conserved.",

@ARTICLE{Fuller2017-ex,
title = "Target {DNA} bending by the Mu transpososome promotes careful transposition and prevents its reversal",
author = "Fuller, James R and Rice, Phoebe A",
abstract = "The transposition of bacteriophage Mu serves as a model system for understanding DDE transposases and integrases. All available structures of these enzymes at the end of the transposition reaction, including Mu, exhibit significant bends in the transposition target site DNA. Here we use Mu to investigate the ramifications of target DNA bending on the transposition reaction. Enhancing the flexibility of the target DNA or prebending it increases its affinity for transpososomes by over an order of magnitude and increases the overall reaction rate. This and FRET confirm that flexibility is interrogated early during the interaction between the transposase and a potential target site, which may be how other DNA binding proteins can steer selection of advantageous target sites. We also find that the conformation of the target DNA after strand transfer is involved in preventing accidental catalysis of the reverse reaction, as conditions that destabilize this conformation also trigger reversal.",

@ARTICLE{Shapiro1979-gf,
title = "Molecular model for the transposition and replication of bacteriophage Mu and other transposable elements",
author = "Shapiro, J A",
abstract = "A series of molecular events will explain how genetic elements can transpose from one DNA site to another, generate a short oligonucleotide duplication at both ends of the new insertion site, and replicate in the transposition process. These events include the formation of recombinant molecules which have been postulated to be intermediates in the transposition process. The model explains how the replication of bacteriophage Mu is obligatorily associated with movement to new genetic sites. It postulates that all transposable elements replicate in the transposition process so that they remain at their original site while moving to new sites. According to this model, the mechanism of transposition is very different from the insertion and excision of bacteriophage lambda.",

@ARTICLE{Harshey2012-qe,
title = "The Mu story: how a maverick phage moved the field forward",
author = "Harshey, Rasika M",
abstract = "This article traces the pioneering contributions of phage Mu to our current knowledge of how movable elements move/transpose. Mu provided the first molecular evidence of insertion elements in E. coli, postulated by McClintock to control gene activity in maize in the pre-DNA era. An early Mu-based model successfully explained all the DNA rearrangements associated with transposition, providing a blueprint for navigating the deluge of accumulating reports on transposable element activity. Amplification of the Mu genome via transposition meant that its transposition frequencies were orders of magnitude greater than any rival, so it was only natural that the first in vitro system for transposition was established for Mu. These experiments unraveled the chemistry of the phosphoryl transfer reaction of transposition, and shed light on the nucleoprotein complexes within which they occur. They hastened a similar analysis of other transposons and ushered in the structural era where many transpososomes were crystallized. While it was a lucky break that the mechanism of HIV DNA integration turned out to be similar to that of Mu, it is no accident that current drugs for HIV integrase inhibitors owe their discovery to trailblazing experiments done with Mu. Shining the light on how movable elements restructure genomes, Mu has also given of itself generously to understanding the genome.",

title = "Horizontally transferred genetic elements and their role in pathogenesis of bacterial disease",
author = "Gyles, C and Boerlin, P",
abstract = "This article reviews the roles that laterally transferred genes (LTG) play in the virulence of bacterial pathogens. The features of LTG that allow them to be recognized in bacterial genomes are described, and the mechanisms by which LTG are transferred between and within bacteria are reviewed. Genes on plasmids, integrative and conjugative elements, prophages, and pathogenicity islands are highlighted. Virulence genes that are frequently laterally transferred include genes for bacterial adherence to host cells, type 3 secretion systems, toxins, iron acquisition, and antimicrobial resistance. The specific roles of LTG in pathogenesis are illustrated by specific reference to Escherichia coli, Salmonella, pyogenic streptococci, and Clostridium perfringens.",
